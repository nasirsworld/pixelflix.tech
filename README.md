## 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate **B.Tech CSE student** who wears multiple hats — writing clean code by day, gaming through the night, and editing epic videos in between. I thrive in creative chaos, competitive arenas, and late-night coding sessions.

🔧 **Programmer**  
From building full-stack web apps to solving algorithmic challenges, I'm always sharpening my skills and exploring new technologies.

🎮 **Gamer**  
Gaming isn’t just a hobby — it’s part of who I am. I love streaming, competing, and building communities around the games I enjoy.

🎞️ **Video Editor**  
I turn raw clips into captivating stories. From gaming montages to competition recaps, I bring creativity and precision to every frame.

🏆 **Competitive Spirit**  
I actively take part in hackathons, coding competitions, gaming tournaments, and creative challenges — always striving to learn, grow, and win.
